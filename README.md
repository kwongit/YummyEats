# YummyEats

YummyEats is a website clone of UberEats with the name, YummyEats, being inspired by one of the co-developers, Danny Yum. YummyEats allows users to browse a large database of various restaurants with each restaurant having their own menu items to order from as well as users being able to create a review for each restaurant. Users also have the option to create their restaurant on YummyEats and add menu items to each of their owned restaurants. YummyEats was developed by aspiring software developers, Kevin Won, Danny Yum, Ehab Zaki, and Kenny Doan during their time at App Academy. After learning Python for 2 weeks, the group was challenged with a project to create a website clone of their choosing while using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy and previously learned languages/libraries like JavaScript and React. The group chose to clone UberEats due to UberEat's popularity and wanted to challenge themselves to create a popular website that is commonly used by many individuals and businesses. Implementing newly learned technologies mixed in with previously taught technology was equally challenging and rewarding to see all of their knowledge tested and brought to life. The group's website clone can be viewed at https://yummy-eats.onrender.com/.
